# Sample site

I put together this project as a sample PHP project. I cleaned it up a bit and put it on Github so that anyone can learn from this project.

This project is meant for absolute beginners. 

## Concepts

The project covers these concepts:

 * PHP variables
 * PHP arrays
 * PHP functions
 * Pretty links (/about) with fallback to query string (?page=about)
 * Basic example of separation of concerns (functionality, content, template)

If you are a beginner and would like me to explain something in the code, or if you already know PHP and have some recommendation for the project, please [create an issue](https://github.com/AkashPatel1/sample-site/issues/new) .

## Lisence
